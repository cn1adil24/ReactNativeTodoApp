# My React Native Todo App

## Overview

Welcome to mu React Native Todo App! This is a versatile to-do list application that comes with unique features like item editing and item pinning. This project was born out of a need for a to-do app that goes beyond the basics and offers more advanced functionality.

## Features

- Create and manage your to-do lists.
- Add, edit, and delete tasks within each list.
- Easily mark tasks as completed.
- Pin important tasks for quick access.
- User-friendly and intuitive interface.

## Version 1 (v1)

This is the initial release of my React Native Todo App (v1). It provides a solid foundation for managing your to-do lists with added flexibility and convenience. I am committed to continuously improving and expanding the app's functionality.

## Back Story

The idea for this app came about because I couldn't find an existing to-do app that met all my needs. I wanted a single app that could handle multiple to-do lists, allow me to easily edit tasks, and prioritize important items by pinning them. My React Native Todo App was born out of this necessity, and I hope it proves to be as valuable to you as it has been to me.

## Future Plans (v2)

In the next version (v2), I have exciting plans to introduce a "Multiple Lists" feature. This will enable you to organize your tasks even more efficiently by categorizing them into distinct lists or projects. Here's a sneak peek at what's coming in v2:

- Create and manage multiple to-do lists.
- Switch between different lists seamlessly.
- Improved task categorization and sorting options.
- Enhanced user customization and themes.

I am dedicated to making this app the best tool for task management, and of course your feedback will be invaluable in shaping its future. If you have any suggestions or feature requests, please feel free to open an issue or reach out to me.

## Upcoming Releases

I plan to release my React Native Todo App on both the Play Store (Android) and the App Store (iOS). Stay tuned for updates on the progress!
